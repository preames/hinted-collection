The majority of the code in this repository is available under a BSD 3-clause license (see below).  The collector code itself is based on a modified version of the Boehm-Weiser collector.  My additions are available under either the original licensing terms of the collector framework or a BSD 3-clause (below) at your option.  The original collector code is, of course, under it's own licensing terms only.
